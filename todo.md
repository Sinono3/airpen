- [x] Finish analyze outliers
- [x] "Fix outlier's orientation" pure function
- [x] Normalize dataset i.e. (x - mean)/std
  - This is a smoother alternative to the set min=-1, max=1 for every input.
- [x] Discard vertical (Y) dimension
- [x] Data augmentation with pen roll rotation implementation
- [x] Correct normalization procedure
- [x] fix record crash bug
- [ ] train/val/test proper separation
- [ ] extract dataset mean/std on preprocessing, and save into npz
- [ ] Proper logging with `aim+logging+hydra`
- [ ] Save everything in the corresponding Hydra run dir
- [ ] Actually save best model, not last model
- [ ] Set dataset args (used labels, normalize) in config, not hardcoded
- [ ] Separate train/test/split logic from dataloader. Fix broken test script.
- [ ] Maybe separate augmentation logic from preprocessing, and embed directly in `training`?
- [ ] Scale/time translation data augmentation
  - may need to scale acceleration too. Need to observe this phenomenon manually first.
  - to observe it: record one slow A, a faster A, and so on, each time faster, until it's really fast.
  - the time scale be faster, and the acceleration should be greater.
  - we should try to replicate this in the scaling augmentation.
- [ ] incompatible pair finder script
